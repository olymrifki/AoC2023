In this part, the problem is still the same, but the walls will be infinitely repeated pattern of the original walls
And the max steps is 26501365

The main assumpsion here is that we have a square input

I cant solve this. But from online discussions, it seems to have a for every size of input
I confirm this using wolfram alpha by inserting times when we need to expand the wall pattern,
a magic number with the size of our input seems to be a factor to predict when we need to expand. (Maybe this is not the general case, but good enough to solve)

This is not the solution, this will print out a pattern and a number n.
1. Copy the pattern into wolfram alpha (LMAO) and get some quadratic formula.
2. Substitute the n to this formula. That is the answer.
